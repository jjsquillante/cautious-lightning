</div>

## context

cosmos is supposed help register cosmonauts for their upcoming space travels.

cosmos:

- receives requests to go to space
- sees what shuttles are available
- selects a shuttle
- adds a cosmonaut to a shuttle for departure
- updates the shuttle data
- `console.log`s an invitation with shuttle depature information to the cosmonaut

lots of people want to go to space, but it is not working!
